## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.



🦒 Navigate through the carousel to show the animals.

🐨 Click on the button to get a new set of 10 random animals.

🐅 Fully responsive design that works on any size screen.


## Optimizations:

The CSS code needs to be refractored and the data is slow to load sometimes. I could also add JavaScript functionality that hides the carousel arrows when you reach the beginning or end of the carousel.

## Lessons Learned:

For this project I wanted to learn how to create a carousel. I fetched data from a public API, grabbed the properties I wanted to use, and iterated through the data using a forEach loop to display each animal in the DOM using a carousel feature.
